					Melvins Public House is the product of a house divided. Melissa
					(a.k.a. Mel or Melvin) a Cleveland Browns & Ohio State fan and Mike a
					Pittsburg Steelers & Penn State fan, met in the neighboring Wasatch
					mountain town Park City and now call Heber their home. Enthusiasts of
					the local area, they found that it was an easy decision to open a true
					locals hangout where every fan has a place to support, cheer and
					commiserate with other locals over good food and drinks.

				<p className='bio ft-white'>
					They earned there place in the local food and beverage trade well
					before opening this local’s favorite sports bar in Heber City and now
					this historic site offers a family friendly atmosphere filled with big
					screens, tasty food and a full bar serving cold drinks. Staying true
					to a locals spot, Melvins is a fun place for more than just sports,
					you can find live music and other events and specials that fill the
					weekly calendar for all to enjoy.

					When the snow melts and the mountains and valleys turn green with
					vegetation, be sure to step out and enjoy the outdoor patio. A perfect
					spot to rest and refuel the body as you are passing through or even
					finish a long day at work. It doesn’t take long to be welcomed as part
					of the Melvins family and familiar faces become new friends.
